# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

My motivation was to build a site that can be used to study notes taken on the topics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The prework study guide was made to provide an easy to navagate site that can be used to refer back to anytime a bootcamp student was to go over what they learned in the prework portion of the bootcamp. This solves the problem of an easy to find/easy to read study guide for bootcamp students. In making this study guide I learned the basics of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned how to use GitHub and GitBash to follow the Git Flow.

## Installation

## Usage

The primary use for this site is for bootcamp students to be able to study what was learned in the prework aswell as explore how to site functions. With a right click of the mouse a student can click on the Inspect tab and observe the lines of code that went into the site they are looking at. Students are also able to go into the console tab and see the JavaScript at work.
